## Introduction

The Smoke Detector project aims to develop a system that can automatically detect the presence of smoke in images. This can be useful in various applications, such as fire detection systems, security cameras, and environmental monitoring.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to explore the code and data.

## Data

The project uses a dataset of images containing both smoke and non-smoke instances. The dataset is available in the [DataSet](smoke_detection_iot.csv). You can download additional data or use your own if needed.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction. You can find these preprocessing steps in the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts. Various facets of the data were also depicted in great detail both quantitatively and pictorially.

## Machine Learning Models

We have implemented various machine learning models for smoke detection, including:

- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bayes' Classifier

You can find the code for these models in the respective sections of the [Jupyter notebook](Copy_of_DS3_Project_(1).ipynb) or Python scripts.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as confusion matrices and accuracy scores. You can find the evaluation results in the project code.
